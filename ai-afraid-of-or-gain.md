AI: What Are We Really Afraid Of? What Do We Have to Gain?
===

The robot revolution is neigh. In polarized online fashion, that means either end of days or salvation. In conversations with real people, particular lay-people outside of tech, the feeling I get is that most view AI as existing in Schr√∂dinger box, the possibility of fear and wonder in equal measures. And they would prefer the box stays closed for as long as possible.

Observation, and to a larger degree intent, will decide how the role of AI will play out. But unlike the poor cat with only a coin flip's chance of survival, our ability to direct the future of AI is multifaceted, nuanced, and perhaps more in our control than we might think. There may come a day when we regret having handed over the keys, if we ever do hand over the keys, but the technology is more naissant than that and there are choices within our control that are more pressing.

The are two big thing to know about AI. The first is that as it is right now, it does what it is trained to do. It's very compliant and lives to serve, so to speak. That means any short-comings in design or purpose come from the humans and organizations using the tools to make products and services. And that's a scary thing. We live in a world where psychological well-being is sacrificed for one more click through addictive products. We've created online spaces full of dangerous words from our neighbors, foreign influence, and everything in between. Kids kill themselves over this.

AI is the ugly reminder of the mistreatment of the past and present. As a society, we're still working through a lot of issues, and what were afraid of is that an even more powerful technology tool might amplify the mistreatment of the future. Regulation, while important, can only give us the least bad solution that also appeals to those being regulated.

But the cat is still in box: so what's the alternative? The second big thing you should know about AI is very good at what it does, it is genuinely novel and new, and it is broadly available for use. Using probability instead of formula yields truly amazing results. One aspect worth noting is in its generative capabilities, particularly in experiential interactions. This is technology that can be worth interacting with. 

Auto-assistants (remember clippy?), interactive voice responses, and most websites have failed miserably to provide a delightful experience. The best software avoids interactions, tries to not be noticeable, and attempts to minimize the friction needed to get the job done. It simply has nothing to offer in qualitative human interaction. 

AI can bring a positive experience to even the most mundane tasks. Imagine a world were each use of technology left you feeling better, or at least free of anger and frustration. Not just a completed task, but an encounter with respect, appreciation, patience, recognition, kindness, positive outlook, or care and concern.

Historically users, whether customers, employees or product, are seen a means to successfully operate a business. Even those focused on customer or employee satisfaction only weigh the outcome of the resulting transaction. AI can restore the value in the process and experience used to reach the outcome. Being treated well by technology becomes a currency.

Training AI in this manner will will require an in-depth understanding of what it means to treat others well. You can't deconstruct compassion or respect without first understanding what it means to embody those qualities. Ironically, this may be anathema to current business values at many organizations. Companies forced to outsource their empathy may need to yield ownership of customer relationship, or simply be replaced by companies that embed positive AI-driven interactions into their offerings.

We should welcome an AI world driven by the need to treat people well, instead of the expectation of mistreatment. Though it will require intention and investment, it's worth opening the box of possible outcomes of the robot revolution.
