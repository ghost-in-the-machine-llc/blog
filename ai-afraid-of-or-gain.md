AI: What Are We Really Afraid Of? What Do We Have to Gain?
===

The robot revolution is nigh. In polarized online discourse, this can mean either the end of days or salvation. In conversations with those outside of tech, particularly laypeople, I often find that most view AI as existing in Schrödinger's box, a possibility filled with equal measures of fear and wonder. Many would prefer the box to remain closed for as long as possible.

Observation, and to a larger degree, intent, will decide how the role of AI will play out. But unlike Schrödinger's cat, with only a coin flip's chance of survival, our ability to direct the future of AI is multifaceted, nuanced, and perhaps more in our control than we might think. There may come a day when we regret having handed over the keys, if we ever do, but the technology is more nascent than that, and there are more pressing choices within our control.

There are two big things to know about AI. The first is that, as it stands now, it does what it is trained to do. It's very compliant and lives to serve, so to speak. That means any shortcomings in design or purpose stem from the humans and organizations using the tools to create products and services. That's a scary thing. We live in a world where psychological well-being is sacrificed for one more click through addictive products, creating online spaces full of dangerous words from our neighbors, foreign influence, and more. Tragically, some even take their lives over this.

AI is an ugly reminder of past and present mistreatment. As a society, we're still working through many issues, and what we're afraid of is that an even more powerful technological tool might amplify future mistreatment. Regulation, while important, can only give us the least bad solution that also appeals to those being regulated.

But the cat is still in the box: so what's the alternative? The second big thing you should know about AI is that it's very good at what it does. It's genuinely novel and new, and it's broadly available for use. Using probability instead of formulas yields truly amazing results, especially in its generative capabilities, such as experiential interactions. This is technology worth interacting with.

Auto-assistants, interactive voice responses, and most websites have often failed to provide a delightful experience. The best software avoids interactions, attempts to be unnoticeable, and minimizes the friction needed to get the job done. It simply has nothing to offer in qualitative human interaction.

AI can enhance even the most mundane tasks. Imagine a world where each use of technology left you feeling better, or at least free of anger and frustration. Not just a completed task, but an encounter filled with respect, appreciation, patience, recognition, kindness, a positive outlook, and care and concern.

Historically, users, whether customers, employees, or products, have been seen as a means to successfully operate a business. Even those focused on customer or employee satisfaction have often weighed only the outcome of the resulting transaction. AI can restore the value in the process and experience used to reach that outcome. Being treated well by technology becomes a currency.

Training AI in this manner will require an in-depth understanding of what it means to treat others well. You can't deconstruct compassion or respect without first understanding what it means to embody those qualities. Ironically, this may be anathema to current business values at many organizations. Companies forced to outsource their empathy may need to yield ownership of customer relationships, or simply be replaced by companies that embed positive AI-driven interactions into their offerings.

We should welcome an AI world driven by the need to treat people well, instead of the expectation of mistreatment. Though it will require intention and investment, it's worth opening the box of possible outcomes of the robot revolution.
